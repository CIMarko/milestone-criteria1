Hello everyone! 👋

This document outlines the **Milestone criteria** for **Project 1**. It's important to follow this structure carefully to make sure you're on track to succeed. **Focus on the Pass criteria (MVP)** first, and then gradually work towards the **Merit/Distinction criteria** for higher grades. 🚀

## **📌 Milestone breakdown**

### **1. Focus on Pass criteria (MVP) first** ✅

The **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** is the **core foundation** of your project. It is the **bare minimum** that you need to submit to **pass** the project. 📊 

#### Key steps for MVP:
- **Develop essential features**: Make sure the main functionality is working correctly.
- **Ensure basic usability**: The project should be user-friendly and intuitive.
- **Complete core requirements**: Check the rubric for mandatory features you need to implement.

## **2. Use this as a guide** 🗺️

This is your **roadmap** to success! Here are a few tips:
- **Start small** and focus on getting your MVP right.
- **Test your project** regularly to make sure it's working as expected.
- **Ask questions** if you're stuck. Ask mentors, post it in your channel or ask your facilitator 💬

## **3. Stay organized** 📅

- **Plan your work**: Break down tasks into smaller, manageable chunks.
- **Track your progress**: Use tools like **Trello**, **Notion**, or a simple to-do list to keep things on track.
- **Avoid last-minute rush**: Start early and give yourself enough time to refine your project.

## **Good Luck, and Happy Coding!** 👨‍💻👩‍💻

Remember: Focus on the **MVP first**, and then take it to the next level to aim for **Merit** or **Distinction**. 💪
