                                <p>Code is well-organised and easy to follow, and the application has been fully tested,
                                    following a planned, manual testing procedure, with no obvious errors left in the

                                    as described below:</p>

                                <p><strong>Characteristics of performance at DISTINCTION:</strong></p>

                                <p>The learner has documented a clear, justified rationale for a real-world application
                                    and a comprehensive explanation of how it will be developed. The development of the
                                    project has resulted in a fully-functioning, interactive web application, developed
                                    using at least one more advanced technique (e.g., CSS media queries).</p>

                                <p>The finished project is judged to be publishable in its current form with a clearly
                                    evidenced professional-grade user interface and interaction adhering to current
                                    practice. There are no obvious errors in the code. Where there is a clear breach of
                                    accepted design/UX principles or of accepted good practice in code organization,
                                    these are fully justified, appropriate, and acceptable to the target user. It
                                    clearly matches the design and demonstrates the characteristics of craftsmanship in
                                    the code.</p>

                                <p>Code is clearly signposted and there is clear, documented evidence of testing at all
                                    stages of development. There is full evidence of end testing, and there is an
                                    evaluation of bugs that may remain in the code.</p>

                                <p>The development and testing process is clearly evident, and justified, through commit
                                    messages. The project’s documentation provides a clear and detailed rationale for
                                    the development of this project, covering all stages of the development life cycle.

                                <p><strong>Design</strong></p>
                                <p>The design of the web application demonstrates the main principles of good UX design:
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>Information Hierarchy</strong></p>
                                <p>Headers are used to convey structure - each section has a header that is easy to see
                                    and clear to understand.</p>
                                <p>All information displayed on the site is presented in an organised fashion with each
                                    piece of information being easy to find.</p>
                                <p>All resources on the site are easy to find, allowing users to navigate the layout of
                                    the site intuitively.</p>
                                <p>Information is presented and categorised in terms of its priority.</p>

                                <p><strong>User Control</strong></p>
                                <p>All interaction with the site would be likely to produce a positive emotional
                                    response within the user. This is due to the flow of information layout, the clear
                                    and unambiguous navigation structures, and all interaction feedback.</p>
                                <p>When displaying media files, the site avoids aggressive automatic pop-ups and
                                    autoplay of audio; instead, letting the user initiate and control such actions.</p>

                                <p><strong>Consistency</strong></p>
                                <p>Evident across all pages/sections and covers interactivity as well as design.</p>

                                <p><strong>Confirmation</strong></p>
                                <p>User actions are confirmed where appropriate, and feedback is given at all times.</p>

                                <p><strong>Accessibility</strong></p>
                                <p>There is clear conformity to accessibility guidelines across all pages/sections and
                                    in all interactivity.</p>

                                <p>Any design decisions that contravene accepted user interaction, user experience
                                    design principles are identified and described (comments in code and/or a section in
                                    the README).</p>

                                <p><strong>Development and Implementation</strong></p>
                                <p>Code demonstrates accepted standards for readability (including characteristics of
                                    ‘clean code’):</p>

                                <p><strong>Consistent and appropriate naming conventions within code and in file
                                        naming</strong></p>
                                <p>File names and class names are descriptive and consistent.</p>
                                <p>For cross-platform compatibility, file and directory names will not have spaces in
                                    them and will be lower-case only.</p>
                                <p>All HTML attributes and CSS rules are consistent in format, follow standards for the
                                    language, and are appropriate and meaningful.</p>

                                <p><strong>File structure</strong></p>
                                <p>Whenever relevant, files are grouped in directories by file type (e.g., an assets’
                                    directory will contain all static files, and code may be organised into
                                    subdirectories such as CSS, etc).</p>
                                <p>There is a clear separation between custom code and any external files (for example,
                                    library files are all inside a directory named 'libraries').</p>
                                <p>Files are named consistently and descriptively, without spaces or capitalisation to
                                    allow for cross-platform compatibility.</p>

                                <p><strong>Readability</strong></p>
                                <p>Code is indented in a consistent manner to ease readability and there are no
                                    unnecessary repeated blank lines (and never more than 2).</p>
                                <p>Function/class/variable names clearly indicate their purpose.</p>
                                <p>CSS code is split into well-defined and commented sections.</p>
                                <p>Semantic mark-up is used to structure HTML code.</p>
                                <p>HTML and CSS are kept in separate, linked files.</p>
                                <p>CSS files are linked in the HTML file’s head element.</p>

                                <p><strong>Defensive design</strong></p>
                                <p>Any potential user errors are identified and dealt with.</p>

                                <p><strong>Comments</strong></p>
                                <p>All custom code files include clear and relevant comments explaining the purpose of
                                    code segments.</p>

                                <p><strong>Compliant code</strong></p>
                                <p>HTML code passes through the official W3C validator with no issues.</p>
                                <p>CSS code passes through the official (Jigsaw) validator with no issues.</p>
                                <p>JavaScript code passes through a linter (e.g., jslint.com) with no major issues.</p>

                                <p><strong>Robust code</strong></p>
                                <p>No logic errors are found when running code.</p>
                                <p>Errors caused by user actions are handled.</p>
                                <p>Where used, API calls that fail to execute or return data will be handled gracefully,
                                    with the site users notified in an obvious way.</p>
                                <p>Inputs are always validated.</p>

                                <p>The full design is implemented providing a good solution to the users' demands and
                                    expectations.</p>

                                <p><strong>Real World Application</strong></p>
                                <p>Clearly understandable site-specific content is used rather than Lorem Ipsum
                                    placeholder text.</p>
                                <p>The final application is aligned to the user stories presented at the start of the
                                    project.</p>
                                <p>Testing procedures are comprehensive, with a good level of coverage, and have clearly
                                    been followed. All noticeable errors have been corrected or documented.</p>

                                <p><strong>Version Control Systems</strong></p>
                                <p>All code is managed in git with well-described commit messages.</p>
                                <p>There is a separate, well-defined commit for each individual feature/fix.</p>
                                <p>There are no very large commits which make it harder to understand the development
                                    process and could lead the assessor to suspect plagiarism.</p>

                                <p><strong>The Full Application Development Process is Documented</strong></p>
                                <p>The purpose of the application is clearly described in the README.</p>
                                <p>The project's documentation describes the UX design work undertaken for this project
                                    and the reasoning behind it. Wireframes, mockups, diagrams, etc., created as part of
                                    the design process are included in the project.</p>
                                <p>There is a clear separation between code written by the learner and code from
                                    external sources (e.g., libraries or tutorials). All code from external sources is
                                    attributed to its source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies)
                                    in the README.</p>
                                <p>The testing procedure is well documented either in the README or a separate file.</p>
                                <p>The deployment procedure is fully documented in a section in the README file.</p>
                                <p>Clear, well-described, explanatory commit messages describe the development process.
